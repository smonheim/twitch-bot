CREDIT TO https://github.com/xNyo/kirotuso for the boilerplate code. If you are reading this and are a programmer and want to give thanks, please thank them first, then thank me. Additional changes are made by me, github user smonheim, however I believe in giving appreciation to the great people who put together fantastic boilerplate code for us developers to use.
